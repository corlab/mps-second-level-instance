# mps-second-level-instance
[Jetbrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) Language to allow second level instantiation within solutions.

**Reuse/extend this language** for every language that needs to support second level instantiation in any regard.

The aim is to keep this language refinable and maintainable. It needs to be able to easily adapt to different requirements, in order to be usable as instantiation base for as much languages as possible.

## Tested with
MPS Version: MPS3.4
